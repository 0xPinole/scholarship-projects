# schoolarship-projects

Welcome to my robotics school projects repository! Here, you'll find a collection of projects that I have developed using a variety of tools and programming languages, including ROS, MATLAB, Python, GCC, Assembly, and Prolog.

I believe that robotics is a powerful tool for teaching important STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) skills to students, as well as life skills such as teamwork, problem-solving, and creativity. I hope that these projects will inspire you to explore and learn more about the world of robotics.

If you have any questions or comments, feel free to open an issue in this repository. Enjoy exploring the projects!
